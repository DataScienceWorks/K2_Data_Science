    "# Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook, we introduced the t-test for checking whether the means of two groups differ. The t-test works well when dealing with two groups, but sometimes we want to compare more than two groups at the same time. For example, if we wanted to test whether voter age differs based on some categorical variable like race, we have to compare the means of each level or group the variable. We could carry out a separate t-test for each pair of groups, but when you conduct many tests you increase the chances of false positives. The analysis of variance or ANOVA is a statistical inference test that lets you compare multiple groups at the same time."

    "## One-Way ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "The one-way ANOVA tests whether the mean of some numeric variable differs across the levels of one categorical variable. It essentially answers the question: do any of the group means differ from one another? We won't get into the details of carrying out an ANOVA by hand as it involves more calculations than the t-test, but the process is similar: you go through several calculations to arrive at a test statistic and then you compare the test statistic to a critical value based on a probability distribution. In the case of the ANOVA, you use the [\"f-distribution\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-distribution).\n",

We know that it is the white voters who differ because we set it up that way in the code, but when testing real data, you may not know which group(s) caused the the test to throw a positive result. To check which groups differ after getting a positive ANOVA result, you can perform a follow up test or \"post-hoc test\".\n",

    "The p-values for each pairwise t-test suggest mean of white voters is likely different from the other groups, since the p-values for each t-test involving the white group is below 0.05. Using unadjusted pairwise t-tests can overestimate significance, however, because the more comparisons you make, the more likely you are to come across an unlikely result due to chance. We can adjust for this multiple comparison problem by dividing the statistical significance level by the number of comparisons made. In this case, if we were looking for a significance level of 5%, we'd be looking for p-values of 0.05/10 = 0.005 or less. This simple adjustment for multiple comparisons is known as the [Bonferroni correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction).\n",

Another common post hoc-test is [Tukey's test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tukey%27s_range_test).

In this case, the test suggests we reject the null hypothesis for 3 pairs, with each pair including the \"white\" category. This suggests the white group is likely different from the others. The 95% confidence interval plot reinforces the results visually: only 1 other group's confidence interval overlaps the white group's confidence interval."
